Note: this theme is currently designed primarily for HTML, CSS, and JS. While it works with other languages, the quality may vary.

**TokyoDark Purple** is a purple-tinted, Tokyo Night–inspired theme for JetBrains IDEs with soft visuals, deep contrast, and Fleet-style syntax highlighting.

Designed for developers who love a dark aesthetic with just enough mood to feel like a rainy night in New York. 
Smooth gradients, muted purples, and intuitive coloring make this theme easy on the eyes during late-night coding sessions.
